Realization of dynamic shadows using the omnidirectional shadow maps technique.

>The technique is mostly similar to directional shadow mapping: we generate a depth map from the light's perspective(s), sample >the depth map based on the current fragment position, and compare each fragment with the stored depth value to see whether it >is in shadow. The main difference between directional shadow mapping and omnidirectional shadow mapping is the depth map we use.
